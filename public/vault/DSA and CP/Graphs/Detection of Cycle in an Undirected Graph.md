### Approach 1: Using BFS
1. You traverse through the graph using BFS from any starting point. but instead of just storing nodes we store nodes and their parents as tuple (node,parent)
2. When you are adding the neighbours to the queue after visiting them you first check if they have been visited.
	- Now in case they are visited already just check if that neighbour is the parent of the current node or not. If there is no cycle , the node is connected to only one neighbour and if has been visited means its through that neighbour only, and hence neighbour = parent.
	- If not then there must be a cycle, return True.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
  private: 
  bool detect(int src, vector<int> adj[], int vis[]) {
      vis[src] = 1; 
      // store <source node, parent node>
      queue<pair<int,int>> q; 
      q.push({src, -1}); 
      // traverse until queue is not empty
      while(!q.empty()) {
          int node = q.front().first; 
          int parent = q.front().second; 
          q.pop(); 
          
          // go to all adjacent nodes
          for(auto adjacentNode: adj[node]) {
              // if adjacent node is unvisited
              if(!vis[adjacentNode]) {
                  vis[adjacentNode] = 1; 
                  q.push({adjacentNode, node}); 
              }
              // if adjacent node is visited and is not it's own parent node
              else if(parent != adjacentNode) {
                  // yes it is a cycle
                  return true; 
              }
          }
      }
      // there's no cycle
      return false; 
  }
  public:
    // Function to detect cycle in an undirected graph.
    bool isCycle(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
        // initialise them as unvisited 
        int vis[V] = {0};
        for(int i = 0;i<V;i++) {
            if(!vis[i]) {
                if(detect(i, adj, vis)) return true; 
            }
        }
        return false; 
    }
};

int main() {
    
    // V = 4, E = 2
    vector<int> adj[4] = {{}, {2}, {1, 3}, {2}};
    Solution obj;
    bool ans = obj.isCycle(4, adj);
    if (ans)
        cout << "1\n";
    else
        cout << "0\n";
    return 0;
}
